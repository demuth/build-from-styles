## Introduction

In this lesson we will build a github.io site for the upcoming training of the DUNE Computing HWDB which has learning materials presented using the Software Carpentry (SC) templates. 

Identify SC lesson template source:
Work from the latest version of the lesson template, to verify versioning, visit https://github.com/swcarpentry,  and check out the meta-repository to help navigate the lessons and repos of the SC Community: https://github.com/swcarpentry/swcarpentry 

Scrolling down, under Lesson template: We maintain a set of CSS and Jekyll scaffolding that can be used to help organize and create lessons in our style (swcarpentry/styles). Instructions for how to contribute are in swcarpentry/lesson-example.
Collapsed Accordion: An observation at https://github.com/carpentries/styles indicates no commits to the styles repo have been made in the last 2 years, with latest release: styles v9.5.3 Latest on Aug 21, 2018.
